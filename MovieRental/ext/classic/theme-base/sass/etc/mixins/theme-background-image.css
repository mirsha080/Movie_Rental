/*
 * Method which inserts a full background-image property for a theme image.
 * It checks if the file exists and if it doesn't, it'll throw an error.
 * By default it will not include the background-image property if it is not found,
 * but this can be changed by changing the default value of $include-missing-images to
 * be true.
