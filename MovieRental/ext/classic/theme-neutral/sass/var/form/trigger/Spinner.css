/**
 * Creates a visual theme for spinner field triggers.  Note this mixin only provides
 * styling for the spinner trigger buttons. The text field portion of the styling must be
 * created using {@link Ext.form.field.Text#css_mixin-extjs-text-field-ui}
 *
 * @param {string} $ui
 * The name of the UI being created. Can not included spaces or special punctuation
 * (used in CSS class names).
 *
 * @param {boolean} [$ui-trigger-vertical=$spinner-trigger-vertical]
 * `true` to align the up/down triggers vertically.
 *
 * @param {number} [$ui-trigger-width=$form-trigger-width]
 * The width of the triggers.
 *
 * @param {number} [$ui-field-height=$form-text-field-height]
 * The height of the text field that the trigger must fit within.  This does not set the
 * height of the field, only the height of the triggers.  When {@link #css_mixin-extjs-spinner-trigger-ui $ui-trigger-vertical}
 * is true, the available height within the field borders is divided evenly between the
 * two triggers.
 *
 * @param {number/list} [$ui-field-border-width=$form-text-field-border-width]
 * The border width of the text field that the trigger must fit within.  This does not set
 * the border of the field, it is only needed so that the border-width of the field can
 * be subtracted from the trigger height.
 *
 * @param {string} [$ui-trigger-vertical-background-image=$spinner-trigger-vertical-background-image]
 * The background image sprite for vertically aligned spinner triggers
 *
 * @param {string} [$ui-trigger-up-background-image='form/spinner-up']
 * The background image for the "up" trigger when triggers are horizontally aligned
 *
 * @param {string} [$ui-trigger-down-background-image='form/spinner-down']
 * The background image for the "down" trigger when triggers are horizontally aligned
 *
 * @param {string/list} [$ui-trigger-up-glyph=$spinner-trigger-up-glyph]
 * The glyph for the "up" spinner trigger trigger when {@link Global_CSS#$enable-font-icons} is `true`.
 *
 * @param {string/list} [$ui-trigger-down-glyph=$spinner-trigger-down-glyph]
 * The glyph for the "down" spinner trigger trigger when {@link Global_CSS#$enable-font-icons} is `true`.
 *
 * @param {color} [$ui-trigger-glyph-color=$spinner-trigger-glyph-color]
 * The color of spinner triggers when {@link Global_CSS#$enable-font-icons} is `true`.
 *
 * @param {color} [$ui-trigger-background-color=$form-text-field-background-color]
 * The background color of the spinner triggers
 *
 * @param {boolean} [$ui-classic-border=$form-text-field-classic-border]
 * `true` to use classic-theme styled border.
