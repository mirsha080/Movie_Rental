/**
 * @class Ext.mixin.Toolable
 */
/**
 * Toolable components need special handling for their padding. When there are no tools
 * (which usually means no dock wrapper) the padding on all sides is placed on the body-el,
 * However, when the component has tools, the horizontal padding needs to be removed
 * from the body-el and placed on the innermost dock wrapper so that the horizontal padding
 * is between the outermost tools and the left/right edges of the component.  In this
 * configuration the space between the body and the tools is provided by the tools
 * themselves via $tool-spacing.
 *
 * The vertical padding remains on the body-el so that the height of the toolable component
 * when auto-heighted is determined by the body-el's line-height + padding  + the element
 * borders. The tools gain an additional advantage from this arrangement because it means
 * they can be taller than the component's line-height and not cause the component's height
 * to increase since they are not "inside" of the vertical padding.
